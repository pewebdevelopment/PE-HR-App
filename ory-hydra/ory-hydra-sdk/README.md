ORY Hydra is a hardened OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server optimized for low-latency, high throughput,
and low resource consumption. ORY Hydra *is not* an identity provider (user sign up, user log in, password reset flow),
but connects to your existing identity provider through a [consent app](https://ory.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/oauth2.html#consent-app-flow).
Implementing the consent app in a different language is easy, and exemplary consent apps
([Go](https://github.com/ory/hydra-consent-app-go), [Node](https://github.com/ory/hydra-consent-app-express)) and
[SDKs](https://ory.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/sdk.html) are provided.

Besides mitigating various attack vectors, such as database compromisation and OAuth 2.0 weaknesses, ORY Hydra is
able to securely manage JSON Web Keys, and has a sophisticated policy-based access control you can use if you want to.

## What is ORY Hydra?

ORY Hydra is a server implementation of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework and the OpenID Connect Core 1.0. Existing OAuth2
implementations usually ship as libraries or SDKs such as [node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server)
or [fosite](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues), or as fully featured identity solutions with user
management and user interfaces, such as [Dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex).

Implementing and using OAuth2 without understanding the whole specification is challenging and prone to errors, even when
SDKs are being used. The primary goal of ORY Hydra is to make OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 better accessible.

ORY Hydra implements the flows described in OAuth2 and OpenID Connect 1.0 without forcing you to use a "Hydra User Management"
or some template engine or a predefined front-end. Instead it relies on HTTP redirection and cryptographic methods
to verify user consent allowing you to use ORY Hydra with any authentication endpoint, be it [authboss](https://github.com/go-authboss/authboss),
[auth0.com](https://auth0.com/) or your proprietary PHP authentication.

### OAuth2 and OpenID Connect: Open Standards!

ORY Hydra implements Open Standards set by the IETF:

* [The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
* [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819)
* [OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009)
* [OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662)
* [OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591)
* [OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7592)
* [OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps-10)

and the OpenID Foundation:

* [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
* [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)

## ORY Gatekeeper

<img src="https://www.ory.am/images/ory-security-console.png" alt="ORY Gatekeeper Console" align="right" width="40%">

Gatekeeper is a firewall for APIs. It detects and prevents malicious requests and makes sure that no unauthorized requests reach your servers. Gatekeeper is set up in minutes, works with existing APIs, and makes use of ORY's popular open source ecosystem.

**Learn more about [Gatekeeper](https://www.ory.am/products/api-security) and try it for free!**

## Quickstart

This section is a quickstart guide to working with ORY Hydra. In-depth docs are available as well:

* The documentation is available on [GitBook](https://ory.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/).
* The REST API documentation is available at [Apiary](http://docs.hydra13.apiary.io/).

### 5 minutes tutorial: Run your very own OAuth2 environment

The **[tutorial](https://ory.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/tutorial.html)** teaches you to set up ORY Hydra,
a Postgres instance and an exemplary identity provider written in React using docker compose.
It will take you about 5 minutes to complete the **[tutorial](https://ory.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/tutorial.html)**.

### Installation

There are various ways of installing ORY Hydra on your system.

#### Download binaries

The client and server **binaries are downloadable at [releases](https://github.com/ory/hydra/releases)**.
There is currently no installer available. You have to add the ORY Hydra binary to the PATH environment variable yourself or put
the binary in a location that is already in your path (`/usr/bin`, ...).
If you do not understand what that all of this means, ask in our [chat channel](https://gitter.im/ory-am/hydra). We are happy to help.

#### Using Docker

**Starting the host** is easiest with docker. The host process handles HTTP requests and is backed by a database.
Read how to install docker on [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/), [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/mac/) or
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/). ORY Hydra is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/hydra/).

You can use ORY Hydra without a database, but be aware that restarting, scaling
or stopping the container will **lose all data**:

```
$ docker run -e "DATABASE_URL=memory" -e "ISSUER=https://localhost:4444/" -d --name my-hydra -p 4444:4444 oryd/hydra
ec91228cb105db315553499c81918258f52cee9636ea2a4821bdb8226872f54b
```

*Note: We had to create a new docker hub repository. Tags prior to 0.7.5 are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/ory-am/hydra/).*

**Using the client command line interface:** You can ssh into the ORY Hydra container
and execute the ORY Hydra command from there:

```
$ docker exec -i -t <hydra-container-id> /bin/sh
# e.g. docker exec -i -t ec91228 /bin/sh

root@ec91228cb105:/go/src/github.com/ory/hydra# hydra
Hydra is a twelve factor OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider

[...]
```

#### Building from source

If you wish to compile ORY Hydra yourself, you need to install and set up [Go 1.9+](https://golang.org/) and add `$GOPATH/bin`
to your `$PATH` as well as [golang/dep](http://github.com/golang/dep). To do so, run the following commands in a shell (bash, sh, cmd.exe, ...):

```
go get -d -u github.com/ory/hydra
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ory/hydra
dep ensure
go install github.com/ory/hydra
hydra
```

**Notes**

* We changed organization name from `ory-am` to `ory`. In order to keep backwards compatibility, we did not rename Go packages.
* You can ignore warnings similar to `package github.com/ory/hydra/cmd/server: case-insensitive import collision: "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus" and "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"`.

## Security

*Why should I use ORY Hydra? It's not that hard to implement two OAuth2 endpoints and there are numerous SDKs out there!*

OAuth2 and OAuth2 related specifications are over 400 written pages. Implementing OAuth2 is easy, getting it right is hard.
ORY Hydra is trusted by companies all around the world, has a vibrant community and faces millions of requests in production
each day. Of course, we also compiled a security guide with more details on cryptography and security concepts.
Read [the security guide now](https://ory.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/security.html).

## Reception

Hydra has received a lot of positive feedback. Let's see what the community is saying:

> Nice! Lowering barriers to the use of technologies like these is important.

[Pyxl101](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11798641)

> OAuth is a framework not a protocol. The security it provides can vary greatly between implementations.
Fosite (which is what this is based on) is a very good implementation from a security perspective: https://github.com/ory/fosite#a-word-on-security

[abritishguy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11800515)

> [...] Thanks for releasing this by the way, looks really well engineered. [...]
